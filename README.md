======
Configuring Travis CI

## Feature Tasks  
#### Doubly Linked List
* Given the LinkedList class presented during lecture, add a`find(value)` method that returns a node (if present) that corresponds to a particular value.
  * You can assume that the linked list won't have duplicate values

## Tests
Unit test each method of your class. 

## Documentation
In your README.md describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include it's arity (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and it's behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to write any additional information in your README.md.
